# Progress

A living handoff document. Written so the next engineer (or the next session) can
continue seamlessly.

## Last updated

2026-06-21. Session 1 (Phase 0 foundation, plus the agent action integration).

## Agent action integration

The 200 agent behaviors shown in the banner are now a working part of the IDE,
wired through every layer:

- **Contracts**: a canonical `AgentAction` catalog (`packages/contracts/src/actions.ts`),
  200 actions across 20 categories, each mapped to its `AgentEventType`,
  `PixieState`, and a plain-language caption. `MotionDirective` gained an
  `actionId` field.
- **Motion**: `classifyAction(event)` (`packages/motion/src/classify.ts`) resolves
  any real event to its most specific action (git kind, command keywords, tool
  name). The mapper stamps the resolved `actionId` onto every directive.
- **Icons**: `scripts/gen-action-icons.mjs` extracts the 200 pixel symbols from
  the banner into a sprite (`apps/desktop/src/assets/pixie-actions.svg`), verified
  to match the catalog exactly. `ActionIcon` renders Pixie performing any action.
- **App**: the Pixie stage shows Pixie performing the current action, and the
  activity feed shows each event's action icon, label, and caption, with the
  action id in the drill-down.
- **Docs**: `docs/agent-actions.md` is generated from the catalog by
  `scripts/gen-actions-doc.mjs`.

All layers build, type, test, and lint clean.

## What the Phase 0 session delivered

The complete Phase 0 foundation, built, typed, tested, and linted clean.

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces, TypeScript strict (with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
  and `verbatimModuleSyntax`), ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest, Changesets,
  EditorConfig. Root `tsconfig` project references across all packages.
- **Frozen contracts** (`packages/contracts`): the `AgentEvent` schema and typed
  payloads, the IPC command and event protocol, the `ProviderAdapter` contract,
  the Pixie motion shapes and the `EVENT_TO_STATE` table, the full design-token
  system with four bundled themes, the plugin API, and shared app state. 14 unit
  tests. This is the keystone; everything imports only from here.
- **Specs** (`specs/`): 27 specification documents, about 12,700 lines, covering
  the vision, architecture, event schema, providers, mascot, swarm, design system,
  editor, terminal, git, chat, MCP, permissions, context and checkpoints,
  settings, sessions, cost, onboarding, accessibility, sound, plugin SDK, testing,
  performance, security, build and distribution, and CI.
- **Twelve packages**, each with real initial domain logic, a passing test suite,
  and a README:
  - `design-system`: tokens to CSS variables, theme registry, theme resolution.
  - `core-shell`: immutable panel-tree layout model, fuzzy command registry.
  - `editor`: file-tree model, visible-row flattening, tab manager.
  - `terminal`: typed PTY client over the IPC contract, plus a fake transport.
  - `agent-runtime`: AgentEvent-to-AgentTree reducer, session manager.
  - `providers`: provider registry, Claude Code stream-json line parser.
  - `motion`: the event-to-motion mapper (captions, intensity, mood, priority,
    dwell, gaze). The brain of the soul.
  - `swarm`: roster, delegation edges, token aggregation, layout selection.
  - `chat`: timeline builder (collapses tool calls with results), turn grouping,
    inspector model.
  - `git`: `git status --porcelain` parser, git-action event builder.
  - `persistence`: session serialize and parse with validation, settings deep
    merge, in-memory secret store.
  - `plugin-sdk`: plugin host with manifest validation and registration lifecycle.
- **Desktop app** (`apps/desktop`): Tauri 2 shell with a Rust core implementing
  real filesystem and OS-keychain commands, and a React 19 renderer that plays a
  scripted demo session driving the Pixie stage and an activity feed with raw
  drill-down. The typed IPC bridge mirrors the contract.
- **Repository polish**: an attractive SVG banner, a professional README with
  badges, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, code of conduct, security policy,
  issue and PR templates, and CI workflows.

## Quality gates (all green)

- `pnpm build:packages` builds all 13 packages via `tsc -b` project references.
- `pnpm -r run typecheck` is clean across every package and the app.
- `pnpm test` passes (every package has a real test suite).
- `pnpm lint` passes with no errors.
- Zero em dash characters anywhere in the repository.

## Key decisions

- **One event schema**: all providers normalize into `AgentEvent`; everything
  visual consumes only `AgentEvent`. This is the load-bearing decision.
- **Contracts are frozen and versioned** (`AGENT_EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  `IPC_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `PLUGIN_API_VERSION`). Payload types are declared as
  `type` aliases so they are assignable to the loose `payload` record without a
  cast.
- **pnpm workspaces** over npm for the monorepo. Documented in `specs/TECH_STACK.md`.
- **Packages ship real domain logic now, UI later.** The initial layers are pure,
  testable TypeScript that depend only on `@vsclaude/contracts`. React, Monaco,
  xterm, and Rive integrations are tracked in `ROADMAP.md` as the next milestones.
- **Authorship**: commits are attributed to the repository owner only.

## Next session should

1. Wire the `@vsclaude/motion` mapper into the desktop app, replacing the local
   `motion-lite` stand-in, so the demo runs through the real mapper.
2. Stand up the `design-system` component primitives and Storybook, with a story
   for every Pixie state and mood.
3. Begin the Monaco integration in `editor` and the xterm WebGL terminal wired to
   the Rust PTY.
4. Author the Rive artboard for Pixie and the sprite-sheet fallback.
5. Implement live process spawning in `providers` (Claude Code first) so a real
   session can drive the views end to end.

## Notes and caveats

- The Rust core (`apps/desktop/src-tauri`) is written but not yet compiled in this
  environment (the Rust toolchain was not installed). Install `rustup` plus the
  platform Tauri prerequisites, then `pnpm tauri:dev`. See
  `specs/BUILD_AND_DISTRIBUTION.md`.
- App icons are not yet generated. Run `pnpm --filter @vsclaude/desktop tauri icon
  <source.png>` to produce the `src-tauri/icons` set before a native build.
